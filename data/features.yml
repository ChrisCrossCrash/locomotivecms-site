- Wagon:
    long_name: Designed for developpers
    description: |
      <p>There is no proper development workflow when making a site with a CMS solutions. Contents, design and configuration are stored in a database, some CMS even let users modify files in production!
      <br/>We are developers. We need to use our favorite IDE, to track our code in Git, and use efficient tools (HAML, Sass, Compass, ...etc.).
      <br/>We know how much time we gain when using the right tools.
      <br/>LocomotiveCMS is shipped with <strong>Wagon</strong>, a command line tool that makes it easy to develop a site locally the way you want.</p>

- Custom content:
    long_name: Custom content types
    description: |
      <p>With most CMS, everything has to be blog posts (or pages, or articles) and building anything else requires hacks and plug-ins.
      <br/>LocomotiveCMS is different: it doesn't impose any specific data structure. Need a page for your band's discography?
      <br/>Create a new "recording" content type with a title, year, album cover, and track listing. It only takes minutes!
      <br/>Custom content types are even flexible enough to build a contact form.</p>

- Multi sites support:
    long_name: Multi sites support
    description: |
      <p>With a single instance of LocomotiveCMS, you can manage as many websites as your server can physically handle. 
      <br/>Deploying a website becomes just a matter of pointing your website domain to your LocomotiveCMS server. No webserver tweaking, no application rebooting at all.</p>

- Templates:
    long_name: Template inheritance with Liquid
    description: |
      <p>No need to learn one more weird syntax. We use Liquid, the most common templating language in Ruby. With Liquid, templates won't affect the security of your platform, and its syntax is simple to learn. 
      <br/>Of course, since we are always looking for ways to improve things, we also tweaked it a lot. For instance, we added the notion of template inheritance that we took from Python. And we wrote a large collection of useful helper tags covering a large number of needs: google analytics snippet, pagination snippet for collections, helper to reach an external webservice and display contents from it, etc.</p>

- User experience:
    long_name: Great user experience
    description: |
      <p>We believe that user experience should not be get the short end of the stick in an open source application. So we put a lot of time into the user interface and global experience, and we often tweak things until they're just right. 
      <br/>For instance, CTRL+S will save a page in AJAX without refreshing. You will love how fast your clients learn to manage their sites.</p>

- Inline editing:
    long_name: Inline front-end editing
    description: |
      <p>When we discovered Aloha-Editor, a very powerful and promising browser editor named, it was instantly clear for us that we had to integrate it into LocomotiveCMS! 
      <br/>This is quick to implement: designers just need to define editable regions in their templates, and those regions become editable by authors directly from the page theyâ€™re viewing.</p>

- I18n Multi-Languages:
    long_name: I18n Multi-Languages
    description: |
      <p>Internationalization is probably one of the most wanted features, especially for a majority of non-american freelancers / agencies. Just define the languages your site will speak and you are good to go.
      <br/>We make it easy for authors to edit all the content of their sites in the different languages.</p>

- Restful API:
    long_name: Restful API
    description: |
      <p>Wagon already takes benefits of the new API system by giving the ability to push a theme to any LocomotiveCMS engines.
      <br/>Be creative, we are sure you will find plenty other ways to use the built-in API.</p>

- Ruby On Rails:
    long_name: Ruby On Rails
    description: |
      <p>We know that most people just want something that works, and don't care if it's written in Python, PHP, or Cobol. But in the case of LocomotiveCMS, we think its language is a huge asset. 
      We built Locomotive with Ruby on Rails 3, which gives developers the ability to build their own application on top of the LocomotiveCMS engine. 
      This means that Locomotive can be integrated in a wide range of applications. Want to develop your own hosting websites platform? No problem!</p>

- In The Cloud:
    long_name: In The Cloud
    description: |
      <p>Since we wanted people to be able to install LocomotiveCMS without setting up a server, we decided that LocomotiveCMS would run on Heroku, the famous Ruby cloud platform. What's more, the database can also be hosted in the cloud (thanks to MongoHQ), and all the files uploaded from LocomotiveCMS are stored on Amazon S3.
      <br/>With a such combination of powerful cloud services, we are able to host several websites for a couple of cents per month! But, of course, you are free to install on your server too!
