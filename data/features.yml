- Custom content:
    long_name: Custom content types
    description: |
      <p>With most CMS, everything has to be blog posts (or pages, or articles) and building anything else requires hacks and plug-ins.
      <br/>Locomotive is different: it doesn't impose any specific data structure. Need a page for your band's discography?
      <br/>Create a new "recording" content type with a title, year, album cover, and track listing.
      <br/>Our custom content types are even enough flexible to build a contact form.</p>

- Multiple Sites:
    long_name: Multi sites support
    description: |
      <p>With a single instance of Locomotive, you can manage as many websites as your server can physically handle.
      <br/>Deploying a website becomes just a matter of pointing your website domain to your Locomotive server. No webserver tweaking, no application rebooting at all.</p>

- Templates:
    long_name: Template inheritance with Liquid
    description: |
      <p>No need to learn one more weird syntax. We use Liquid, the most common templating language in Ruby. With <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a>, templates won't affect the security of your platform, and its syntax is simple to learn.
      <br/>Of course, since we are always looking for ways to improve things, we also tweaked it a lot.
      For instance, we added the notion of template inheritance that we took from <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">Python</a>.
      And we wrote a large collection of useful helper tags covering a large number of needs: google analytics snippet, pagination snippet for collections, helper to reach an
      external webservice and display contents from it, etc.</p>
