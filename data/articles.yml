! 'Changelog #1':
  :_permalink: changelog-1
  :body: ! '<p>Here is a pretty exhaustive list of what the BIG MERGE includes:</p>

    <ul><li>upgrade the list of gems: Rails 3.0.9, Devise 1.3.4, Rake 0.9.2, &#8230;etc </li>

    <li>roles with the CanCan gem<br/><em>note</em>: 3 kind of roles. <strong>Administrator</strong>
    (they can do everything), <strong>Designer</strong> (like Administrator but applied
    on a single website), <strong>Author</strong> (only edit pages and contents) </li>

    <li>resizing images on the fly (ticket #79)</li>

    <li>tinyMCE enhancements (ticket #99):<br/>- the locomotive image plugin has been
    replaced by the locomotive media plugin which allows you to upload any kind of
    files<br/>-  fullscreen mode, very convenient to edit a long text </li>

    <li>remove asset_collections<br/><em>note</em>: the asset collections tab was
    confusing for users (and me too). Actually, it&#8217;s like a content type with
    a different kind of view in the back-office (the galery view is not implemented
    yet)</li>

    <li>use dashes instead of underscores (ticket #56):<br/> <em>note</em>: pages
    (slug) and contents (permalink) uses the parameterize String method.</li>

    <li>SEO (tickets #57 &amp; #90):<br/> - index and index/ are the same page now
    (301 redirection)<br/> - add a seo_title for both the site, the page and content
    objects.<br/> - write a {% seo %} liquid tag to display the title, meta (description
    and keywords) tags depending on the context</li>

    <li>fix issue about httparty (ticket #91)</li>

    <li>check if custom contents are organized in a category when displaying the select
    box for the has_one / has_many fields</li>

    <li>add 2 liquid global variables in the page conext: current time and date. Dates
    from a custom content are now comparable</li>

    <li>site export (but editable_elements inside a page are not correctly handled
    for now)</li>

    <li>rake task to import a remote template</li>

    <li>UI tweaks, a quick list of some of them:<br/>- better hints for the theme
    asset new/edit action<br/>- slight modifications on forms: separator between fields,
    text shadow, error message redesigned, &#8230;etc<br/>- quick link to edit directly
    a model from the submenu </li>

    <li>new sites picker (if the multi_sites mode is enabled and correctly set up)</li>

    <li>the robots.txt can be edited directly from the back-office (site settings)
    (ticket #57)</li>

    <li>2 new languages:<br/>- dutch (#92)<br/> - spanish (#103)</li>

    <li>a lot of internal refactoring as well as a ton of bug corrections</li>

    </ul><p>Checkout the following link for the upgrade procedure:<br/><a href="http://www.locomotivecms.com/support/howto/upgrade"><a

    <p>I&#8217;d like to thank all the contributors, users and developers who reported
    bugs / problems or just simply suggested relevant improvements. Seriously folks,
    <strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH&#160;!</strong></p>

    <p>A very special and big thank to 2 companies. The first one, a german company
    (<a href="http://www.designhunger.de/">designhunger</a>) run by Bernd Hauser,
    funded the has_one / has_many feature. If you are in touch with him, please thank
    him, he deserves it :-) </p>

    <p>The other one is a startup from San Francisco named <a href="http://bushi.do">Bushi.do</a>.
    Sean and Kevin, the 2 owners behind this company, have been helping us so much
    for a couple of months now. They provide us a financial support so that we can
    be focused as much as possible on the CMS. On top of that, they provide us a great
    help for the documentation (believe me they are working hard to deliver a top
    notch FAQ) and they also advise us on the commercial side of LocomotiveCMS. <br/>Working
    with them led, in a first time, to the update to the demo section. Before our
    partnership, the demo section was just a simple application with the same credentials
    for everyone and without the ability to edit the demo website. Now, anyone can
    launch as many LocomotiveCMS websites as they want and do everything possible
    with them&#160;!<br/>The bushi.do people rock and I love their product&#160;! </p>

    <p>To sum up things, I feel so great about LocomotiveCMS&#160;!</p>'

Introducing our modules platform:
  :_permalink: introducing-our-modules-platform
  :body: ! '<p>LocomotiveCMS is a very young open source project but it gets more
    and more users each week. More users also means that we have to deal with more
    work like answering questions, look into feature requests, fixing bugs of course,
    &#8230;etc. That&#8217;s the price of fame&#160;! </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, all of these tasks take a lot of time. At the end, we spend
    more time on LocomotiveCMS than on our other (paid) projects which can compromise
    the future of our CMS.</p>

    <p>That being said, the situation also made us think about how we were going to
    monetize LocomotiveCMS. We had in mind a couple of obvious ideas like providing
    a hosting platform for example. <br/>In fact, we are already collaborating with
    a startup (<a title="bushi.do" href="http://bushi.do">bushi.do</a>) which its
    activity is to who offers hosting solutions for any open source project. We&#8217;ll
    talk about it very soon. Believe us, it i&#8217;s going to be huge&#160;!</p>

    <p>Since we already developed a <a title="Locomotive Editor" href="http://www.locomotivecms.com/modules/locomotive_editor">command
    line tool</a> to quickly build Locomotive websites, we came to the conclusion
    that it would be simpler for us, in terms of development, to sell it.<br/>Moreover,
    our tool was used successfully by a couple of early adopters. Besides, it became
    obvious we were going to sell other tools or modules, for the reason that our
    philosophy on this project is to keep the core engine as simple as possible. One
    thing leading to another, we ended up with the modules marketplace solution.</p>

    <p>The concept behind is quite simple. Let&#8217;s say, as a developer and LocomotiveCMS
    user, you miss a functionality which has a business value for you and certainly
    for other people / companies. No problem&#160;! You develop it with our help (that
    way we validate your idea), we sell it directly from the LocomotiveCMS official
    website and we share the revenues. The percentage will depend on our contribution
    to each module&#8217;s development.</p>

    <p>Does our modules marketplace break the spirit of the open source&#160;? We
    don&#8217;t think so.<br/> First, there is nothing preventing people to use LocomotiveCMS,
    the core engine remaining free of charge and we won&#8217;t force developers to
    sell their modules if they want them to be free. <br/>Secondly, we do need revenues
    to regularly continue the development of Locomotive.<br/> And lastly, we do like
    the idea to imply developers in the whole business environment.</p>

    <p>One more thing :-) We looked for a way to sell ruby gems because all our modules
    will be ruby gems but we didn&#8217;t find anything. <br/>So yes, we built our
    own platform named <a title="GemForSale" href="http://www.gemforsale.com">gemforsale</a>&#160;!
    For now, the marketplace functionality is not totally implemented but the basic
    functionalities are here.</p>

    <p>We strongly believe that selling gems will help a lot of open source projects
    to generate revenues.</p>

    <p>We are pretty excited by the way Locomotive is growing and we believe it&#8217;s
    going to be a major CMS soon, thanks to our users and contributors&#160;!</p>

    <p>By the way, we&#8217;d be glad to get feedback and ideas from you.</p>'

Locomotive status:
  :_permalink: locomotive-status
  :body: ! '<p>First of all, I would to thank all of you who sent us very kind and
    encouraging messages, helped us to fix issues (a lot, let&#8217;s face the truth&#160;!)
    or developed new features. Actually, we were not expecting such a positive wave.
    For instance, the Locomotive back-office has been translated in German (thanks
    Bernd&#160;!), French and Brazilian Portuguese (thanks Raphael&#160;!). Believe
    me, it is always a great moment when you see your app in another language.</p>

    <p>More than that, some companies adopted Locomotive on a daily basis. <a href="http://www.thefrontiergroup.com.au/">The
    Frontier Group</a>, a web design and development company, built many websites
    powered by our engine. The feedbacks given by 3 of their employees (Dirk, Mario
    and Karl) were tremendous helpful for our CMS. They did an amazing job by fixing
    a lot of issues and answering questions from the community. <br/>I also could
    name John, Bernd, Raphael, Benjamin for their great help. I hope actually I don&#8217;t
    forget someone :-) </p>

    <p>By the way, folks, if you built a site with Locomotive and you want to show
    proudly your work, send us an email, we will feature you on our blog (+ twitter
    as well).</p>

    <p><strong>Will there be a roadmap&#160;?</strong></p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t think so. At first, I tried to release specific versions of the
    Locomotive gem. But, pretty quickly, it seemed clear to me that it does make any
    sense since, unfortunately, there still were bugs to be fixed the day after, making
    the release quickly outdated. That is mainly because Locomotive is still a young
    project.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I keep up-to-date a todo list for tasks / issues / new features. Let
    me share the main ones with you. By the way, the order does not reflect the priority:</p>

    <ul><li>documentation. [UPDATE] documentation about the liquid syntax is coming
    soon.</li>

    <li>duostack version. LocomotiveCMS should work with both Heroku and Duostack
    only by specifying it in the locomotive.rb config file.</li>

    <li>associations in the custom content types. simple at the beginning: belongs_to/has_many</li>

    <li>internationalization. Pages, content types, assets have a different version
    depending on the locale (specified in the url or the domain).</li>

    <li>enhancement of the inline editing module. Uploading images is not implemented
    for now for instance, &#8230;etc.</li>

    <li>a better way to install locomotive in a mono-site mode.</li>

    <li>dynamic image resizing. Only by using a special liquid tag, the image (images
    from asset collections and content types) will be resized. {{ &#8216;foo.png&#8217;
    | transform: &#8216;500x400#&#8217; | image_tag }}. Varnish + Rack.</li>

    <li>moving all the Locomotive models into a brand new namespace. (Locomotive::Site,
    Locomotive::Page, &#8230;etc). Crucial for a better integration in another Rails
    app.</li>

    <li>convert css into scss.</li>

    <li>integration with an existing rails app. I wish Locomotive could be used as
    the cms module of any Rails app.</li>

    </ul><p>As you can see, nothing major (except for the &#8220;Internationalization&#8221;)
    because I am following the same rules I apply since the beginning. Keep the core
    as simple / light as possible and refine / refactor as often as possible. Besides,
    I pay attention to the delivered code, or at least I try to.</p>

    <p>My mojo&#160;? The development of new features should be only driven by the
    need of them.</p>

    <p><strong>Want to contribute&#160;?</strong></p>

    <p>A lot of people asked me what was the best way to contribute to the project
    and how they could help. My answer is quite simple. Use Locomotive for your websites
    for real&#160;!!! If you need a feature or if you run into a bug, fork the project,
    fix or implement and then submit your pull request on github.</p>

    <p>Anyway, again, thanks to all of you who were enough patient to check Locomotive
    despite the bugs and saw its great potential&#160;!</p>

    <p><strong>What&#8217;s next&#160;?</strong></p>

    <p>It seems that some people get worried about the durability of LocomotiveCMS
    which is, in my point of view, a very pertinent question. <br/>First, as I mentioned
    it at the beginning of the post, a lot of companies are using Locomotive meaning
    that you will always find someone who can help you.<br/>Then and that&#8217;s
    the beauty of the open source, you are not an hostage of a product. I mean, the
    code is clear and can be easily modified.<br/>Lastly, things are moving fast for
    Locomotive and we are going to announce some big news in the next weeks. I will
    talk more about it in my next post. </p>

    <p>choo-choo :-)</p>'

Beta release out:
  :_permalink: beta-release-out
  :body: ! '<p>Hi folks, </p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been a long road to launch this beta. That was really tough to stop
    adding new features and to be focus to release something. Yes, I had to struggle
    against my nature but I managed at the end&#160;!</p>

    <p>I spent a lot of time writing a good installation guide, especially for the
    Heroku part. I hope it is clear enough. If it is not, feel free to send me your
    suggestions at info@locomotivecms.com.</p>

    <p>Besides, I added the <a href="http://www.locomotivecms.com/support/themes">themes
    section</a>, which is useful if you want to try Locomotive with a real example.
    <br/>I just took some nice templates from different gallery templates or blog
    (thanks <a href="http://inspectelement.com/tutorials/code-a-backwards-compatible-one-page-portfolio-with-html5-and-css3/">Tom</a>
    by the way&#160;!) and converted them for Locomotive. I suggest you to take a
    look at them because you will understand how the Locomotive templates and the
    other modules work.<br/>Actually, it is pretty easy to convert a html template
    since I have a special tool for that. I call it the Locomotive Editor (fancy name,
    isn&#8217;t it&#160;?). Basically, it is based on the locomotive engine bundled
    in a Sinatra app but without mongodb and other stuff like the back-office for
    instance. The edition of templates, contents and other assets can be done with
    a simple text editor, Textmate in my case. Once I&#8217;m done with a theme, I
    simply zip the folder and import it in Locomotive.<br/>For now, I don&#8217;t
    plan to open source the editor. It depends on the way I&#8217;m going to &#8220;monetize&#8221;
    Locomotive. Even if I&#8217;ve got several ideas, I&#8217;ve not taken a decision
    yet.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the next steps for Locomotive&#160;?</strong></p>

    <p>First of all, I expect a lot from developers. I&#8217;m looking for feedbacks
    and even for bugs to solve&#160;! <br/>On my side, I&#8217;m going to write tutorials.
    The first one will be probably about how to create a custom content and use it
    in a liquid template. </p>

    <p><strong>You are a company and you want to use Locomotive to host a couple of
    websites&#160;?</strong></p>

    <p>Even if you build super sexy and big apps, you always have to manage some simple
    websites for small clients. That&#8217;s not a problem anymore&#160;! I&#8217;m
    willing to help companies which want Locomotive as their website hosting solution
    for their clients. Locomotive is definitely a good fit for you&#160;! For instance,
    I&#8217;ve got a single Locomotive instance running on Heroku and serving 3 websites
    (<a href="http://www.locomotivecms.com"><a href="http://www.locomotivecms.com">http://www.locomotivecms.com</a></a>
    is one of them).</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m very excited to see how Locomotive&#8217;s going to turn out&#160;!
    I&#8217;m sure it will help people a lot to build and edit websites. That&#8217;s
    the reason why I created it.</p>'

A fresh coat of paint:
  :_permalink: a-fresh-coat-of-paint
  :body: ! '<p>When Didier first approached me to work on a user interface for <a
    href="http://www.locomotiveapp.org">Locomotive</a>, his content management system
    (at the time still called NoCoffeeCMS), I thought it was a great opportunity to
    finally design my ideal CMS interface. I’ve worked with Joomla, Wordpress, Textpattern,
    and Expression Engine, and none of them had that perfect mix of features, flexibility,
    and good design (although Wordpress and Expression Engine came pretty close).</p>

    <!--more-->

    <p>I was inspired by the tabs of <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">The
    Hit List</a>, a Mac to-do app, and quickly came up with a first mockup, which
    ended up being pretty close to the final product.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-1-big.png"><img height="200"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-1.png"
    title="lc-1" class="size-full wp-image-388 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>We tweaked the colors and buttons some more, and came up with the idea of assigning
    a different color to each tab.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-2-big.png"><img height="200"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-2.png"
    title="lc-2" class="size-full wp-image-389 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>Around that time, we also came up with the name “Locomotive”. We liked how
    it related to the Rails world, and evokes something powerful enough to pull a
    lot of weight. I remember how I used to play Railroad Tycoon (now renamed <a href="http://www.2kgames.com/railroads/railroads.html">Railroads</a>)
    as a kid, and went looking for locomotive inspiration. The <a href="http://www.steamlocomotive.com/northern/sp.shtml">Golden
    State Locomotive</a> was a perfect mascot: sleek, powerful, and has a beautiful
    retro art-deco feel.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-3-big.jpg"><img height="300"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-3.png"
    title="lc-3" class="size-full wp-image-390 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>Since I can’t draw anything more complex than a modal pop-up, the very talented
    <a href="http://www.grardesign.com/">Emmanuel Grard</a> did the actual vector
    rendering of the locomotive.  For the front-end site, we knew that we wanted something
    that matched the back-end’s colors and style. But I went too far in trying to
    keep things simple, and the result looked uninspired and dry.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-4-big.png"><img height="200"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-4.png"
    title="lc-4" class="size-full wp-image-391 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>Thankfully Didier wasn’t afraid to call me out on it and push me harder, and
    so the second version was completely different, and much more promising.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-5-big.png"><img height="200"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-5.png"
    title="lc-5" class="size-full wp-image-392 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>But something was still missing. The design felt flat and lacking impact, and
    more importantly my girlfriend didn’t like it (<a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>
    might be nice, but no one beats girlfriends when it comes to giving out criticism)  It
    was also clear that the site didn’t evoke the Ruby universe enough. It was time
    for a bold move.</p>

    <p><a href="http://sachagreif.com/wp-content/locomotive/lc-6-big.png"><img height="200"
    width="500" src="http://www.sachagreif.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lc-6.png"
    title="lc-6" class="size-full wp-image-393 aligncenter"/></a></p>

    <p>Applying a single gradient turned out to make a huge difference, and all the
    other elements started falling into place. A few tweaks later, Locomotive’s home
    page was finally good to go.  By the way, you might have noticed that the site
    doesn’t have any navigation. I liked the idea of the homepage being self-contained.
    I think it encourages people to scroll down the page, while reassuring them that
    they won’t need to browse through dozens of pages to find the info they need.  So
    there you go. I encourage you to give Locomotive a try, and await your feedback
    on the design and general user experience.</p>'
