    video_transcript: "<p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>: Hello Jeremy, please introduce yourself
      and your company</p><p><b>Jeremy Seitz</b>:&nbsp;My name is Jeremy Seitz. I'm
      the Head of Web Engineering here at Local.ch. We are the official phone book
      in Switzerland and we have about four and a half million unique users in the
      country that use our website everyday.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS:
      </b>How did you first heard about locomotive CMS?</p><p><b>Jeremy Seitz</b>:&nbsp;I
      first heard about LocomotiveCMS through other developers here in Zurich. In
      2012 we were looking for a solution that was compatible with our Ruby on Rails
      platform through the website which we launched in that year. One of the things
      that was attractive to me about it was that it was actually built in rails.
      We tried it out first as an experiment and very quickly began to adopt it in
      a more broad way throughout the company.</p><b><p></p></b><p></p><p></p><p><b></b><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What
      other tools and products did you use before that have been replaced by LocomotiveCMS?</p><p><b>Jeremy
      Seitz</b>:&nbsp;Before LocomotiveCMS we were using a whole lot of different
      things. We had WordPress installations, we had custom CMSs, we had static files
      that were maintained by hand and this was a lot of pain actually because it
      required different interfaces, different strengths and weaknesses for each product
      and it was a nightmare to manage. We're able to replace nearly all of those
      with Locomotive. Personally, I was using Radiant and Refinery on the Rail Side
      as well for CMS projects before.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What were
      your greatest challenges when creating websites for yourself or your clients
      before you started using LocomotiveCMS?</p><p><b></b></p><p><b><b>Jeremy Seitz</b></b>:&nbsp;Some
      of the biggest challenges were trying to figure out how to customize things
      as CMSs often came with a lot of features and were very rigid. The challenge
      was you felt like you have to bend or break the CMS into doing what you wanted
      it to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Locomotive, on the other hand, starts very simple and
      very small and it's up to you to build it out.</p><p>The other challenge that
      we had was one of support and maintenance. We had products that were not open
      source, which made it difficult to troubleshoot problems and make changes and
      improve things. We're dependent on external vendors to do stuff for us.&nbsp;
      Another issue was just architectural. &nbsp;Locomotive out of the box was built
      on Rails, which was something we're already familiar with and hosting in high
      performance environment. In addition, it used MongoDB which was the database
      that we also had chosen to use.</p><b><p></p>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How is
      LocomotiveCMS different from comparable tools you have used before?<p></p><p>
      </p><p><b>Jeremy Seitz</b>: Locomotive is very different from the products we
      used before because it's based on something that is centered around models.
      In addition to having page content, which all CMSs have, it has this concept
      of models and the models can be customized. This gave us great flexibility when
      we we're building out new features and it also made the editing and maintaining
      the content very easy.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing about it that was nice was
      the fact that in the back office we could customize the content areas that people
      edited in a way that made it really resemble what was on the page. They didn't
      have to learn special formatting, they didn't have to learn tricks or whatever
      to make the content look the way the designer wanted it to look. They could
      simply enter the content in the right places.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, it provided
      a much better compatibility. We have to support four languages as a Swiss company
      and out of the box it was very good at internationalization and supporting translations
      strings &nbsp;and things like that. Quite a lot more features and architecturally,
      the design of it, the way it interacted with the database and the tool wagon,
      which is this command line tool that we use to pull and push content, means
      that we can edit templates using our editors like developers like to do. They're
      not forced to use the web based interface to do everything. That was a big win
      for us.&nbsp;</p><p>We could also check the content into source control, which
      was a huge win as well. There are many features that are really just super valuable
      for us.</p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What has your experience using LocomotiveCMS
      been like so far and since starting to use LocomotiveCMS, what has changed about
      your work?<p></p><p></p><p><b>Jeremy Seitz</b>: So far we’ve had a good experience
      with Locomotive. We were able to use it very quickly and also we were able to
      very quickly train and help the people that have to use it every day. Initially,
      Locomotive was only used in a couple of places here at Local. As of today, it’s
      now used to host most of our content-driven public websites including things
      like user information and guides and help and things like that. This is an advantage
      for us because we can customize each solution based on what it is that is needed
      and it makes it easier for us to support people because we know that we have
      a common interface, a common set of tools that everyone is using for the content
      across the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the fact that everything is stored
      in Mongo is great for us because MongoDB is the database that we use across
      our organization now for the web and mobile so this makes it easier on our system
      administrators as well that they don’t have to maintain separate databases for
      CMS.</p>In general, our job as developers has become easier. More importantly,
      we get great support from the people that make Locomotive. They’re always very
      responsive to us and they’ve helped us a lot with some of the more complex solutions
      that we’ve tried to build. That’s been a big difference for us.<br><p></p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How
      do use LocomotiveCMS in your work?</p><p></p><p>We use Locomotive in our work
      everyday not only for just editing and maintaining content that appears on the
      homepage or on various content areas of the site but we also use it in a number
      of kind of unusual ways. We use it sometimes as a database for storing things
      like images that need to be displayed. We sometimes use it like an API for storing
      things like categories or bits of content that need to appear in certain parts
      of an application. It’s a very flexible tool in the sense that we’re not just
      storing pages of content in it. We’re actually using it like an API and this
      gives us the flexibility to be able to manage things in a central interface
      but the results are all over the website.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, through the
      web team, we do deployments to the website applications and we treat the CMS
      deployment separately. This decoupling has actually made it much more flexible
      for us. In the past, it was common to have your CMS be your application and
      one of the primary differences is that Locomotive is essentially CMS as a service.
      This means that we can decouple the content from the application completely
      and when we make changes or improvements to the CMS, we can deploy them separately
      from our applications. That gives us increased flexibility in our day to day
      work.</p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What feedback have you gotten from your
      clients from the LocomotiveCMS back office and do they find it easy to use?*<p></p><p></p><p><b></b>As
      we rolled out Locomotive throughout our organization, we generally got very
      positive feedback from people that they were able to work with it very quickly.
      Some people felt it was very similar to the interface that they used before.
      Other people it was a big change but because the interface of the back office
      is fairly simple, that made the transition pretty easy. In general, we’ve had
      a good reaction for people having to do common tasks like uploading images or
      managing content in multiple languages. These tasks are pretty easy. In general,
      people at Local who have to use Locomotive find it pretty easy to use so that’s
      been the majority of the feedback that we’ve gotten from the users here. &nbsp;<br><br><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:
      What was your aha moment or the moment you knew you loved LocomotiveCMS?</p><p><b>Jeremy
      Seitz</b>:&nbsp;The real aha moment for me with Locomotive was when we were
      working with it and we suddenly realized that it was also an API meaning that
      we can not only use it as a CMS but we could use it as a service and for me
      this was a game changer because in the past if someone said, we need to store
      a bunch of data and it needs to be available to different applications, we would
      need to build something for them. We’d have to build a database. We’d have to
      build an app. We’d have to deploy it somewhere and test it. With Locomotive,
      we have a CMS instant support. We can simply create a new model. We can then
      create a template that returns data in HTML or JSON &nbsp;and this is immediately
      usable by our web and mobile applications so it’s a huge time saver in the sense
      that it allows us to quickly create APIs and to add new data to our apps without
      having to do a lot of work. The content management part of it is already taken
      care of.\t<br><br><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How do you see yourself working
      with LocomotiveCMS in the future?</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p>We’re definitely
      planning on expanding our use of Locomotive. We’re currently replacing more
      legacy applications that we have that are using Locomotive. We are going to
      be rolling it out further within the organization. We were very excited about
      the upgrades that are planned in the new back office interface and we intend
      to use that. We’re also adding single sign-on, which will be very helpful for
      our users so they don’t need special accounts for Locomotive. They can use their
      normal company account to log in, which makes it easy. More importantly, we
      plan to push our content in general online and Locomotive is a big part of that
      strategy.</p>* This video was shot before we released V3 and our new WYSIWYG

      yourself?</p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;My name is Paul Eckenrode and I’m
      the owner of 360Durango.com</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>: Tell us why you made
      a switch to LocomotiveCMS</p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>: We began using LocomotiveCMS
      because we had the opportunity to really customize the back end. We could educate
      clients on how to change their content on their website they way they wanted
      to change it. That customization feature is really unique and that's why we
      made the change.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What were your greatest challenges
      in creating websites for yourself or your clients before LocomotiveCMS?<br></p><p><b>Paul
      Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;The biggest challenges that we were looking to overcome
      was the fact that we were usually locked within a template and we couldn't totally
      customize, either the front end or the back end, just the way that the client
      wanted it to be.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How was LocomotiveCMS different
      from comparable tools you have used before?<b>&nbsp;</b>What problems does LocomotiveCMS
      solve or what does it make easier?</p><p></p><p></p><p><b><b><b><b></b></b></b>Paul
      Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;The thing that LocomotiveCMS makes much easier for companies
      like mine and the clients that we serve is that we can really customize how
      they can go about changing the content. There may be a particular way that they
      want to go about changing, maybe a different piece of inventory or a product
      or a different property that they're trying to feature, they way they want to
      change that and how they want that to look and function, we're able to customize
      that for them. That is a really nice feature for us.</p><p>LocomotiveCMS: What
      has your experience using LocomotiveCMS been like so far and since starting
      to use LocomotiveCMS, what has changed about your work?<br></p><p>Using Locomotive
      CMS has been great. I can see that my skill set has really changed and developed
      because I'm not a developer. I'm not a programmer. I'm not even a graphic designer.
      What I do is really try to figure out what our clients are trying to do with
      a website and help them figure out how the best way to achieve that is.&nbsp;</p><p>One
      of the things Locomotive has changed about my work is it's given me a new tool
      in the tool belt that I didn't have before. I can go a little bit further with
      the customization of websites. We can get things a little bit more dialed in.
      The Back Office is really easy to use and I can make manipulations in the websites
      that I was not able to do before.</p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How do you use
      Locomotive CMS in your work?<p></p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;I use Locomotive
      CMS every day in my work whether it's &nbsp;continuing to build new websites
      or tweak things or train clients on how to use it.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What
      feedback have you gotten from your clients from the Locomotive CMS Back Office?
      Do they find it easy to use?</p><p></p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;The best
      feedback from clients when it comes to content management systems is no feedback.
      That means that everything is working for them. The feedback that we have received
      is it's just exactly what they were looking for. They're amazed that they can
      actually do some of the things that they can do on their own with very little
      to no website or development experience.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What
      was your 'aha' moment? The moment that you knew you loved Locomotive CMS?</p><p><b>Paul
      Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;The 'aha' moment for me with Locomotive CMS was when we
      actually started developing these models and I could change and reorder cabins
      and photos and prices so easily on the back side. It was just ... It blew my
      mind.</p><p></p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;How do you see yourself working
      with Locomotive CMS in the future?&nbsp;</p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;Going
      forward, we'd like to continue to push the envelope of where Locomotive CMS
      is capable of going. We love the ability to customize different features within
      it, including searchable functions of the different models that are created.
      One of the things that we really like is the ability, once again, to customize
      the models, the front end, the Back Office and that's a great tool to have in
      your tool belt when you're talking about marketing.</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;Why
      did you chose to use First Class?*</p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;The decision
      to move all of our websites over to the hosting service First Class was an easy
      one. We don't have to worry about any down time with our websites. The servers
      are maintained by people who work specifically on servers that are built and
      designed for LocomotiveCMS. We really like that. Another reason why we went
      for First Class is because of the ability to level out our expenditures on server
      maintenance. Sometimes if you're in a web business and you've got a bunch of
      different websites being hosted, you might have an abrupt server maintenance
      that might interrupt your cash flow a little bit. By leveling it out working
      with First Class, has been a good decision.</p><p></p><p>Working with First
      Class is really about the service. Quite honestly, it is first class. The thing
      we like is the responsiveness from their team, the stability of their platform,
      and it's just a great operation. No regrets.</p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>: Thanks
      Paul, would you like to add anything else?<p></p><p><b>Paul Eckenrode</b>:&nbsp;\tThe
      thing I like best about LocomotiveCMS is how customizable the platform is for
      our clients. We can figure out what they want to change, how they want to change
      it, and we can work back from there because it's a clean slate from the beginning.
      That's the best part is we're really able to meet the needs and objectives of
      our clients with a fully customized solution. That's what I like the best about
      LocomotiveCMS.<br><br></p><p><i>* Fist Class is the former name of LocomotiveCMS's

      What were your greatest challenges when creating websites for yourself or your
      clients before using LocomotiveCMS?</p><p><b>Christie Roberts</b>: I''ve used
      a few different Content Management Systems and never really found anything that
      I thought works very well as a whole for the client. Maybe it worked in some
      aspects but not others.</p><p>Before Locomotive, it was also a matter of determining
      the capabilities of my clients - their own computer and technical skills - so
      that when I left them with the end product would they be able to continue making
      their edits and other changes for their website like they requested. I found
      with some of the content management systems that I had been using in the past,
      I was getting a lot of phone calls from my clients to make the changes for them,
      which negates the purpose. It defeats the entire purpose of having a content
      management system for my clients. I don''t feel like i had a lot of successful
      solutions and results from those.&nbsp;</p><p><b></b></p><p>Now, I''m finding
      that when I don''t get the phone calls, that to me is a measurement of success
      when, after my initial training, I don''t hear from them for months unless they
      have a minor question or they just want me to add a feature to their content
      management system.<b><br></b></p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;What has been
      your experience using LocomotiveCMS so far?</p><p><b>Christie Roberts</b>:&nbsp;I''ve
      had a really good experience because coming from the designer''s standpoint,
      I really was looking to move more into the develop standpoint rather than always
      having to work with the development team. Sometimes my deadlines aren''t the
      same as my developers'' deadlines, and I really needed to be able to do that
      myself. With Locomotive, I had the confidence to be able to start the development
      end on my own and be able to create and complete entire websites without the
      help of the developer.</p><p><b><b></b></b></p><p>What I really like about Locomotive
      from a designer standpoint is I''m able to start from a clean slate and design
      from the ground up and only add the features and coding that I want in there.
      I''m also able to be free of a template kind of system where I may not be able
      to create the type of branding strategy for my client or do a seamless continuation
      of their branding.</p><p> I have found that with Locomotive is fully customizable
      because you can start from a clean slate and not have extraneous files that
      you need to work with and customize. That goes two fold because in the back
      office, the only features that are there are what you put there for your client.
      It makes it a lot easier and user-friendly to work back there and not to mention
      that the interface is well organized and easy to find, what you need to find.<b><b><br><br></b></b>Locomotive
      offers me the ability to just completely serve my clients and their needs effectively
      without having to wrestle with any other extraneous codes, extraneous templates,
      extraneous files.&nbsp;<br>I find that to be my biggest success and then just
      the user friendliness of the back office and the different ways that I can tweak
      and do testing on my own has made it very successful for me as a designer.</p><p></p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:&nbsp;Since
      starting to use Locomotive CMS, what has changed about your work?</p><p><b><b>Christie
      Roberts</b></b>:&nbsp;One of the things that''s changed about my work is that
      I''m more confident in recommending features for my clients and understanding
      how the end result is going to play out for them and knowing that I can develop
      and design a certain feature that they''re asking for. With other content management
      systems, there''s not that confidence and ability that what is available on
      the templates, if it''s a template type of system, is really going to work with
      the requests that I have from the clients.</p><p><b><b><b>LocomotiveCMS</b></b></b>:&nbsp;What
      was your "aha" moment, the moment that you knew you loved Locomotive CMS?</p><p><b><b><b><b>Christie
      Roberts</b></b></b></b>:&nbsp;My very first aha moment was when I created a
      simple YAML file and was able to &nbsp;create an entire model that worked right
      from the get-go with some very simple code. That''s one of the options. The
      other option is to work directly in the back office, which I have done as well
      with great success. My second aha moment was when my clients didn''t require
      extra training after I turned the website over to them. It was just a very simple
      training, about 10 to 15 minutes or so, and they were off and running. When
      I didn''t receive phone call after phone call, I really experienced my second
      aha moment that yes, this is indeed is a very good solution for most of my clients.</p><p><b><b><b><b><b>LocomotiveCMS</b></b></b></b></b>:&nbsp;
      Why did you choose to use First Class?*</p><p><b><b><b><b><b><b>Christie Roberts</b></b></b></b></b></b>:&nbsp;Using
      First Class for my LocomotiveCMS sites was, to me, a very valid solution because
      they take care of all the issues. Literally, from the development standpoint

      needed to plan and provide resources for. I knew that the technologies we had
      available weren’t really going to fit all of our problems and so I spent a lot
      of time researching on the internet. Most of the CMS landscape is very much
      dominated by PHP solutions but I was really interested in seeing if we could
      find something that was powered by Ruby. By doing that I’d found a couple more
      solutions and just researched more and after a while I found out that Locomotive
      actually really fit a lot of our needs. </p>\r\n<p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:\tWhat
      other tools/products did you use before are being replaced by Locomotive?</p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>David
      Pierce</b>: Before Locomotive, we used a wide range of tools to build our different
      sites. I’m a huge proponent of making sure that we find the right tool to fit
      the problem and so from static site generators all the way up to things like
      Wordpress, I use a lot of different tools on the dev team to accomplish the
      right goal. Like I mentioned, we did a lot of just handcrafted static sites
      and there’s different tools for that but for this discussion, we spent a lot
      of time and investments in Wordpress because it’s kind of one of the better
      known solutions out there for building sites that have a lot of content management
      problems. </p>\r\n<p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:\tWhat were your greatest challenges
      when creating websites for yourself or your clients before?</p><p><b>David Pierce</b>:
      One of the biggest challenges that we found before was again finding a tool
      that could be as flexible and as complex as the business problems that we wanted
      to solve for. What I really mean by that is Wordpress is a great tool and it’s
      good at what it does but after a while you’d start to run into challenges trying
      to make Wordpress do things it wasn’t designed to do. Now Wordpress does have
      some good extensions for custom post types but I’d often would be encountered
      with business problems that had the model data that just hadn’t really been
      considered before and so that was really one of the biggest challenges. Then
      another big challenge I wanted to solve for managing all that complexity and
      being as flexible as we needed to be while also keeping our developers happy.
      We’re mostly a JavaScript and Ruby shop here and we could have done a lot of
      the PHP solutions and made it work but ultimately our developers are happy when
      they’re using tools that are Ruby based or JavaScript based and so those two
      big things, developer happiness and then honestly business happiness, those
      are two things that I really want to be sure that I was solving for appropriately
      and again, Locomotive really helped us find that good mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS:</b>\tHow
      is Locomotive different from comparable solutions you’ve used before? What problems
      does LocomotiveCMS solve for or does it make easy?</p>\r\n<p><b>David Pierce:</b>\tThe
      thing that helps Locomotive stand out for me is considerations to how developers
      think, how they work and what their workflow looks like. I really hadn’t seen
      a CMS or any platform before that’s so elegantly divided: business concerns
      and developer concerns and so through its use of tools and the separation of
      concerns, we’re allowed to really keep environments that keep everyone happy.
      That thing really stood out to me. </p>\r\n<p>The other thing that really stood
      to me is its commitment to open source. A lot of frameworks that I’ve looked
      at are open source as well but finding something that was as polished for the
      business users and had so much design consideration built into the back office
      but then also too had a lot of really good elegant decisions put into how developers
      work. That was great and being able to crack open the code and see how it worked
      and see how I could contribute back to the community so that other LocomotiveCMS
      users could also benefit from what I’ve learned and that was really attractive
      to me as well. &nbsp;</p><p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>: what has changed about your
      work since you started using LocomotiveCMS?</p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>David
      Pierce</b>:\tMy experience so far, it’s actually been pretty positive. It’s
      been flexible enough and intuitive enough for my business users but it’s also
      been the kind of thing that if I’m having to bring in developers or extra help
      or resources into the problem, you don’t have to learn the entire CMS to contribute
      to a site build. If all that you really want to learn is how to work with CSS,
      SaaS or JavaScript, Wagon is really nice in that you don’t have to learn the
      entire stack to contribute to a site. It’s made it really easy to be flexible
      with how I pulled resources into a particular site, ranging from a very big
      site that needs a lot of investment to just kind of a small site that I need
      to kick out a couple pages, I can really be flexible with that. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The
      other thing that I really enjoyed about this is Locomotive does content modeling
      very well and so I can sit down with the business users and really understand
      what structured editable content needs to look like, what parts of the page
      they might need to change, just how flexible the back office needs to be and
      so that’s really great that I can just sit down and think about all of that
      and know that that directly match the things that Locomotive are very good at.
      </p>\r\n<p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:\tHow do you use LocomotiveCMS in your work?</p>\r\n<p><b>David
      Pierce</b>:\tThe way that we use it now is I usually start by sitting with …
      My clients are internal clients so I start by understanding their business needs,
      what problems that they’re trying to solve, what kind of message and story they
      want to tell and really what I’m looking for is what structured content do I
      need to make available in the back office. When I sit down and understand all
      the requirements and say does this fit within the range that Locomotive will
      excel at? If it’s a smaller site that just needs not … like pretty static content
      then I can direct them in other places but once they start figuring out the
      stories that they want to tell and what data goes into that I can start mapping
      that out to models and we can start designing basically what all the requirements
      are and then we just build out the page or pages and then I can sit down and
      say like, “What is missing? What extra things do you need?” Since Locomotive
      is so flexible, we can add those back in. It’s very cheap. It’s not as time
      consuming to sit down and make changes. That makes the developer and business
      interchange pretty quick.  &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:\tWhat feedback
      have you gotten from your clients for the LocomotiveCMS back office? Do they
      find it easy to use?</p>\r\n<p><b>David Pierce</b>:\tYes, the latest feedback
      that I’ve gotten, because I check in with my business users quite a bit is that
      it’s intuitive in that it’s flexible. If something isn’t there that needs to
      be there, it really doesn’t require much of a code change to make it happen
      and what’s really nice about that is I can take those requirements back over
      to developers. We add in some code and we push it to production and it all just
      works. </p>\r\n<p>The business users really like that flexibility where they
      don’t have to adjust their paradigm to kind of suit the framework. The framework
      adjusts to fir their paradigm. Again, that’s the best thing that I can really
      offer to my business users is that each back office for each problem that we
      solve is custom-tailored to the problems that they’re trying to solve. That’s
      been really good. It’s like a system that grows and learns with them and it’s
      what they expect to see when they log in and have to manage their content. &nbsp;<br><b>LocomotiveCMS</b>:\tWhat
      was your aha moment, the moment you knew you loved LocomotiveCMS?</p><p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>David
      Pierce</b>: I was first really inspired to explore Locomotive a lot more when,
      as I was coming through its features and what it could do, I realized that I
      can actually look at the code and see how it works and just seeing that it was
      Ruby. It was understandable and I really liked to think about the fact that
      under the hood, it’s just Rails and it can do what I want it to do and there’s
      a lot of really good best practices and knowledge built up around it. Knowing
      that I can use standard industry tools like New Relic and various distribution
      and deployment platforms, that’s all really compelling. </p>\r\n<p>Also seeing
      the commitment to design and seeing a lot of the contributors onto the project
      and seeing that designers that I … names that I knew and recognized were contributing
      to the success of that project, that was a really good aha but really what’s
      inspiring and this is all inspiring to developers what was really inspiring
      was knowing that I could custom tailor the backend and make it as close to my
      colleague’s problems as possible and knowing that I could really deliver something
      that was very rich and faithful to my non-technical colleagues. That was really
      exciting too and again, the open source part, there’s lots of reasons that I
      fell in love with Locomotive pretty early on. </p>\r\n<p>There isn't a single
      aha moment or me it’s just to further that the more that I spent time looking
      at Locomotive and what it could do and how it was built and the different philosophies
      that it committed to, all of those really kind of came together and really helped
      inspire me to pursue that further. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our
      plans for Locomotive as we grow as a company are just effectively to continue
      using it as we’re using it now. It’s part of my toolkit that I can bring to
      the table when I’m considering problems and how we want to solve them. It’s
      really good. It’s fitting a good sweet spot for smaller to medium-sized builds.
      It’s also really helpful when I’m considering a lot of managed content for our
      business users and so it’s going to continue to be a pretty strong player when
      I’m considering alternatives to help solve our problems internally. </p>\r\n<p>I
      also expect to find and exploit more of the ways that we can save a lot of our
      infrastructure costs. There are really smart ways that I can host multiple small
      sites on one installation with Locomotive. What I’m thinking as a technical
      director, that saves our company money, that saves us maintenance costs and
      I can really can share and spread out a lot of the costs of maintaining websites
      into one place and so that’s really exciting too.</p>\r\n<p>\tThe other ways
      that I expect our company to grow is to continue to contribute back to help
      be a part of making Locomotive better for engineers but also for business users
      and just being a part of the Locomotive community as well. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><p></p>"
