    body: "Setting up a new Rails app, development and production environments, git repositories etc. is just too much work and maintenance for small projects. Thanks to LocomotiveCMS, I no longer have to do all of that. We can now take on new projects we used to turn down before."

    body: "LocomotiveCMS is awesome if you try to publish structured content and if you are not looking for just another WYSIWYG Editor. The way you can expand the CMS, the direct contact to other contributors and the founder of LocomotiveCMS and the chance to influence and discuss the future of the product makes it outstanding besides all the other opportunities."
