    title:  Install the LocomotiveCMS engine <u>ONCE AND FOR ALL</u>
    description: |
      <p>
      Since our CMS integrates the multi-site functionality from day 1, a single instance of LocomotiveCMS can serve as many websites as your server can handle.
      <br/>
      Installing the engine is as simple as installing any other Ruby on Rails application.

    title: Use Wagon to build your websites fast
    description: |
      <p>
      <strong>Wagon</strong>  is our tool to build LocomotiveCMS sites on your local machine with your preferred text editor and without installing the full engine locally.
      <br/>
      No need to be a Ruby guru, just write your pages with our super simple templating
      language, use <strong>Sass</strong> (with Compass) or <strong>Less</strong> to code your stylesheets.
      You can even use <strong>HAML</strong> to avoid typing full HTML code.
      <br/>
      Moreover, you are free to organize your content without a database. You also get to decide which parts your client can edit on his own so he does not mess up with your layout.
      <br/>
      For instance, you need a page for your band's discography? All you need to do is to create a new "recording" content type with a title, year, album cover, and track listing.

      <p>
        Alright, your site looks good and you want your client to enter his or her content
        <br/>
        Thanks to our API, deploying your site built with Wagon to a LocomotiveCMS engine will generate a
        <strong>fully customized back-office</strong> for your clients.
        <br/>
        <br/>
