    %h3 Why choose Locomotive CMS over a proprietary CMS?

    .four
      .item 
        %span &#10003;
        LocomotiveCMS is open source, which means adoption by more users. More users create a larger community of knowledge and support.
      .item 
        %span &#10003;
        You have access to the source code. If you want to tweak something you can. You're not locked in.
      .item 
        %span &#10003;
        Because of the larger community, bugs are noticed and fixed more quickly. You get to enjoy a more secure site.
      .item 
        %span &#10003;
        Since LocomotiveCMS is open source, we practice complete transparency in our claims. You can verify it for yourself.

        If the development team dies in a plane crash (yeah, we know, macabre humor), LocomotiveCMS will keep on steaming along!
      .item 
        %span &#10003;
        You have the same level of professional support that proprietary solutions offer.

        %span &#10003;
        You have the opportunity to contribute your ideas and be a part of something huge. Our management team is accessible and eager to hear your thoughts.
